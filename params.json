{"name":"4tools","tagline":"Because Google is hard.","body":"# 4Tools\r\nToday's Modern™ and Sophisticated™ 4chan user requires more than the standard inline extension.  \r\nHere's how to up your game.\r\n\r\n## Install either 4chan-X or Appchan X\r\nBoth are extensions that work similar to 4chan's inline extension, but with more ~~bloat~~ features.  \r\nI prefer 4chan-X, but Appchan X is a bit more tailored to those who want to customize their visual experience.\r\n\r\n### 4chan-X\r\n**Chrome**: Just install ccd0's version from the Chrome Store [Here]( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/4chan-x/ohnjgmpcibpbafdlkimncjhflgedgpam)  \r\n**Firefox**: First install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), restart Firefox, then install [ccd0's 4chan-X](https://ccd0.github.io/4chan-x/builds/4chan-X.user.js)\r\n\r\n### Appchan X\r\n**Chrome**: Just install Appchan X from the Chrome Store [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/appchan-x/gfibffekgcmgabbfaibbbcapgnfobnoi)  \r\n**Firefox**: First install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), restart Firefox, then install [Appchan X](https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x/raw/stable/builds/appchan-x.user.js)\r\n\r\n## Do a quick configuration\r\nBoth 4chan-X and Appchan X come with reasonable settings out of the box, but you'll need to change a few things.\r\n\r\n### 4chan-X\r\n* Click the wrench in the top right corner on any 4chan page and check the **Show Name and Subject** box under **Posting**\r\n\r\n### Appchan X\r\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  \r\nI'll fill this in once I figure it out. I'll probably just upload reasonable settings from one of the users.\r\n\r\n### Install Namesync\r\nAlmost ready for namefagging! Now you just need to install Namesync to \"enable\" names on /b/ and other Anonymous boards.\r\n\r\n**Chrome**: Just install Namesync from the Chrome Store [Here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/4chan-x-name-sync/oplkokdeabkddkihcbghgmpcamnddegk)\r\n**Firefox**: Install the Namesync [userscript](https://www.namesync.org/namesync/builds/NameSync.user.js)\r\n\r\nAfter reloading a thread, you should be able to see other Namesync user's names and display your own using the fields on the Quick Reply dialog.\r\n\r\n**TODO**: Tripcode junk.\r\n\r\n# You're done!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
